# marketing-analytics-engineering

This project simulates a modern marketing analytics warehouse for a direct-to-consumer ecommerce company.

It demonstrates how raw marketing and ecommerce data can be transformed into
analytics-ready tables that power BI dashboards and performance reporting.

The goal is to show:
- clean SQL transformations
- dimensional modeling
- data validation
- marketing metrics such as revenue, CAC, ROAS, and LTV

This is built using synthetic data and does not use any real company or customer information.
